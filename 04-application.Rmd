# Non-Spatial Work {#nspatial}

My first forays into SyncroSim started with non-spatial runs of a single BpS: the Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest, eco-region 53, identified as the primary biophysical setting in the Ironton district of the Wayne National Forest. Because the forest is disjoint, I used the Ironton district as a representative sample for the entirety of the Wayne in my exploratory work. As the initial runs were done aspatially, the shape of the district didn't matter at this stage, as I set the number of cells manually.

To compensate for the lack of available geospatial data from the precolonial United States, LANDFIRE biophysical models are initialized with equal proportions of each succession class. Models are then run for 1000 time steps to allow the system to equilibrate under experts' best approximation of historic disturbance and transition regimes, and those outcomes are treated as representative of the historic landscape. 

With this in mind, my first step was to isolate the model of interest to me and run it to state class equilibrium. Due to computational limits, I ran only six Monte Carlos of this scenario, so as not to spend the time and memory it would require to run more realizations. This limitation due to processing power was an ongoing theme of my exploratory work, and only my final productions, which did not include historic landscape percentages, were run with more than six realizations. 

I used the proportions of state classes resultant from the historical equilibrium runs and compared them to modern Sclass percent data for the Wayne National Forest, procured from previous work by the Nature Conservancy, running both through time steps 2020-2050, simulating the progression of the landscape 30 years out into the future. To these simulations I added a version for which the total transitions attributed by fire were reduced to zero, reflecting the current fire management regime on the Wayne National Forest.

It was at this point I noticed a discrepancy in the behavior of the succession classes. Notice that when fire is removed, the Late2:Cls class reduces to nearly nothing, while the proportions of Late1:Cls rise to near-complete domination of the landscape. Now look back at the description according to the Allegheny-Cumberland BpS. By all accounts, it is the _mixed-maple_ stands which should dominate in the absence of fire and the oak-hickory forest which ought to become vanishingly small, but this model shows the Late2:Cls class, which corresponds to fire-sensitive mixed-maple woodlands, failing to thrive without fire. 

After a consultation with Randy Swaty of The Nature Conservancy, it was determined that those two states had, in fact, been transposed in the state and transition model. It is unknown at this point whether the LANDFIRE project writ large has been informed of this discrepancy and if it has been corrected.

Above, the red and blue lines show the original model runs, while the green and purple are from after modification to represent the flipped vegetation dynamics. The less dramatic change in class proportions between the green and blue runs reflects the mitigating effect of fire, while without fire, the maple class outcompetes the oak class to near exclusion.

In reality, this model may not accurately describe the vegetation dynamics present on the Wayne National Forest, or else may be misleading in terms of the actualities of stand conversation. In conversation with Lisa Kluesner, of the Wayne Forest Service, she explained that while oak is still substantially present in the ecosystem, the conservation issue of the moment is that of replacement. As individual oaks age and die, or are cut in forest maintenance, the closed canopy prevents sapling growth and replacement of the trees, leading to eventual elimination of oak from the landscape. Fire has not been a routine aspect of forest maintenance in the United States for at least 70 years, and while the landscape of the Wayne is far departed from its precolonial identity, oak has not in that time been driven to complete exclusion: assuming all other factors remain static, it seems unlikely that in the next thirty years there will be a rapid and unprecedented downturn. The mixed-maple stands, in this context, must have their _mixed_ quality emphasized. The transition of the landscape to this succession class represents not a complete vanishment of the existing oak, but a departure from the conditions which make the repopulation of oak viable, despite the persistance of individual organisms. 

With this in mind, and in the understanding that while some characteristic natural vegetation remains on the Wayne National Forest, the actual landscape dynamics are completely and irrevocably altered from what they were 250 years ago, the relevant goals for management are less about preventing the transition and mixing of stands and more about preserving those areas where oak can still grow to maturity as species repositories against the forest-wide continuing deaths of older oaks. In this circumstance, the inevitability of climate change has become a part of the restoration plan. As long as oaks and hickories can persist on those patches of land less hospitable to more mesophytic species, the warming and drying of the landscape will begin to push maples back out, and allow historically characteristic species to move back in, so long as those species can be somewhere preserved through time.

## Future Work

One of the challenges with modeling management options for the Wayne National Forest was that the biophysical setting which covers much of the Ironton district (used in this project as representative for work which could be expanded to the continuous forest and surrounding counties), the Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Woodland and Forest, has only two types of transitions defined: those of fire and succession. While this is perfectly appropriate for the modeling of pre-colonial landscapes, for which BpS were designed, it fails to capture the breadth of disturbances and management practices which may be run on a more fragmented landscape under modern curation. 

Adding transitions designed to reflect this management, and perhaps teasing out the box and arrow diagram in the state and transition simulation model, adding or splitting classes to encompass both uncharacteristic natural vegetation and uncharacteristic exotics currently present on the landscape, would allow for more fine-grained analysis and assessment of the ways in which different policies might contribute to land-management goals. Another modeling aspect to consider adding would be a successively increasing multiplier representing change in climate over time steps, probably using projected temperature increases and their relative effects on different vegetation classes as a proxy for climate change as a whole, with potentially aberrant weather damage thrown in.

For spot-identifying areas of high management value, spatial analysis is necessary, as non-spatial runs can only identify landscape dynamics as a whole, and not areas of higher or lower intervention value, but as non-spatial runs are far less computationally costly than spatial runs, they are a good tool for testing new model parameters and inputs to ensure that the results make sense and are appropriately impacting the model.
