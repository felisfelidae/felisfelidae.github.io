# State and Transition Simulation Modeling in SyncroSim {#stsmssim}

State and transition modeling is a theory predicated on the notion that a single landscape can occupy more than one state, in this case used to describe plant communities which may be characterized as distinct and independent from each other. A state, in general, will remain stable until it is pushed to transition, either through age (as in the succession models discussed in basic ecology) or through disturbance of the landscape. After a landscape transitions from one stable state to another, it will not return to the previous state without another significant disturbance or concerted restoration effort well in excess of the effort it would have taken to maintain the landscape in the first place. The characteristics of a location must be described and parsed from the description of the distinct plant communities which make up the states which occur on that landscape, such that the same community occuring on different sites isn't incorrectly described as two discrete entities.

The backbone of a state and transition model is the set of communities which can occur and remain stable, at least for a time, on a particular landscape, and the relationships between them. In Syncrosim, this web is represented as a directed graph, with vertices representing states for an ecosystem, and arcs representing transitions. The arcs are weighted by the probability of transition from one state to another on any given time step, and direct the flow of the simulated landscape through each of its states. 

State and transition models emerged in the 1980s as a possible guide for the management of rangelands in Australia, but have gained momentum elsewhere, particularly in the United States, as a bridge between ecology and land management. They allow for the simulation of change in a landscape under different natural stressors, management practices, and/or projected effects of climate to give a glimpse into the projected future and a method of assessing trajectory for a landscape, when viewed with the ideal outcomes in mind.

In SyncroSim, these models can be run either spatially or aspatially. Spatial models require an input raster of the landscape in question, with cell values assigned to different states in the model. From there, the software can calculate the total space involved and will perform direct transitions for each cell (size of which may change based on the coarseness or fineness of the  model) at specified intervals according to the transition probability. Spatial models will return maps of the transitioned landscape at each specified timestep, as well as maps for specific transitions, when asked. For an aspatial model, an initial estimate of total area and area by state class must be provided to Syncrosim, after which it simulates proportional probabilistic transitions from state to state with respect to the current relative coverage of each state class.

The SyncroSim software boasts a number of packages for different types of simulations: at its core, a basic state-and-transition model simulates only relational change, and so can be used for applications as varied as finance and epidemiological spread, but only the stsim and stsimsf packages are needed for ecological modeling. SyncroSim also offers a landfirevegmodels package, using biophysical settings taken from The Nature Conservancy's LANDFIRE project, which I used for much of my work, but I ended up needing to use the LANDFIRE models in the stsim package, due to an incompatibility between the rsyncrosim package for R and the landfirevegmodels SyncroSim package.
