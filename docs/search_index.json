As computation has grown more efficient and powerful over the past several decades, and the availability of data, particularly spatial, has ballooned past that which we have the ability to process, the work of ecological computing has become increasingly necessary. The effects of a changing climate need both be captured empirically by tracing through backdated spatial data and modeled into the future, so that landscape managers and those with a vested interest in the preservation of the natural world can plan for conservation and connectivity in the face of these incoming changes. The focus of this project has been the Ironton district of the Wayne National Forest, used as a representative sample for the 17-county area of interest which surrounds the three separate districts of the Wayne National Forest, the larger area singled out by forest managers. We sought to identify alternative management strategies which would facilitate the preservation of historically significant oak and hickory reserves on the landscape, as well as to assess wide-scale connectivity from the perspective of fauna reliant upon those signpost vegetative communities. Landscape models and vegetation data were sourced from the LANDFIRE project. This project was undertaken in partnership and with the generous leadership of Randy Swaty, of the Nature Conservancy and LANDFIRE, and with the academic oversight of Dr. Carri LeRoy, of the Evergreen State College. Special thanks extended to Kim Hall, Bronwyn Rayfield, Leonardo Frid, Kori Blankenship, Lisa Kluesner, Jim Smith, Melissa Clark, and the Conservation Data Lab, without whose support this work would not have been possible. Work for this project was done in Syncrosim (state-and-transition modeling software produced by ApexRMS), ArcGIS Pro (mapping software produced by ESRI), and R (a programming language emphasizing statistical and graphical work, written in the RStudio IDE).

The Athens and Marietta units are jointly managed by the Athens Ranger District, while the more southerly Ironton unit is managed by the Ironton Ranger District. While the forest at large covers 875,000 acres of land, only a quarter of it is owned and managed by the Forest Service, leading to a number of issues with continuity of planning and ability to make and achieve conservation goals, as all policy objectives must be bought into by stakeholders and landowners before they can be pursued. Figure 2.2: Oak trees in the Big Woods Plot of the E. S. George Reserve. Before the entrenchment of colonists upon American soil, the landscape that would become the Wayne National Forest, and indeed, Ohio in general, was dominated by fire-adapted oak-hickory forests. At regular intervals, indigenous peoples set fires which killed the seedlings of other non-invasive species not characteristic of the landscape and providing oak the sun and space that it requires to get to the point in its growth when it can begin to withstand fires. In the absence of fires clearing the understory, faster-growing, shade tolerant maple seedlings are able to take hold and begin to shift the profile of the forest toward maple stands, which prevent oak from regenerating due to the closed-canopy nature of the system. Modern fire suppression in the Wayne National Forest is fast and effective. Two fire departments service the forest area, and though human-generated fire starts are common, especially during spring and fall, they are prevented from taking hold, effectively reducing fire regeneration of the landscape to zero. At present, oak remains the dominant overstory species with a scattering of hickory, but stands are not regenerating, and instead are being replaced by mesophytic species like maple in a feedback loop (termed mesophication1) that has become characteristic of many forests in the eastern United States. Even where overstory transitions to maple are only partial or where oak stands have presisted, mid and understory invasives have caused the landscape to depart significantly from historic character. Realistically speaking, it is an unfeasible goal to return the Wayne National Forest to its precolonial state. Historical records of landscape character are incomplete, reconstructions of landscape will never be perfect, and the state of resource extraction and human land use, both past and present, in the region, as well as the checkered ownership make the idyll of a return impossible. Rather, management objectives center around preserving pools of refuge for the characteristic oak-hickory species which still exist on the landscape (in contrast to the historic grasslands which have largely been converted into agricultural lands) without necessarily pushing for a return to the more open-canopy oak savannahs which were historically characteristic, or attempting any kind of concerted removal of the uncharacteristic native mesic species. "],["stsmssim.html", "Section 3 State and Transition Simulation Modeling in SyncroSim", " Section 3 State and Transition Simulation Modeling in SyncroSim State and transition modeling is a theory predicated on the notion that a single landscape can occupy more than one state, in this case used to describe plant communities which may be characterized as distinct and independent from each other. A state, in general, will remain stable until it is pushed to transition, either through age (as in the succession models discussed in basic ecology) or through disturbance of the landscape. After a landscape transitions from one stable state to another, it will not return to the previous state without another significant disturbance or concerted restoration effort well in excess of the effort it would have taken to maintain the landscape in the first place. The characteristics of a location must be described and parsed from the description of the distinct plant communities which make up the states which occur on that landscape, such that the same community occuring on different sites isnt incorrectly described as two discrete entities. The backbone of a state and transition model is the set of communities which can occur and remain stable, at least for a time, on a particular landscape, and the relationships between them. In Syncrosim, this web is represented as a directed graph, with vertices representing states for an ecosystem, and arcs representing transitions. The arcs are weighted by the probability of transition from one state to another on any given time step, and direct the flow of the simulated landscape through each of its states. State and transition models emerged in the 1980s as a possible guide for the management of rangelands in Australia, but have gained momentum elsewhere, particularly in the United States, as a bridge between ecology and land management. They allow for the simulation of change in a landscape under different natural stressors, management practices, and/or projected effects of climate to give a glimpse into the projected future and a method of assessing trajectory for a landscape, when viewed with the ideal outcomes in mind. Figure 3.1: An example of a state and transition diagram in SyncroSim In SyncroSim, these models can be run either spatially or aspatially. Spatial models require an input raster of the landscape in question, with cell values assigned to different states in the model. From there, the software can calculate the total space involved and will perform direct transitions for each cell (size of which may change based on the coarseness or fineness of the model) at specified intervals according to the transition probability. Spatial models will return maps of the transitioned landscape at each specified timestep, as well as maps for specific transitions, when asked. For an aspatial model, an initial estimate of total area and area by state class must be provided to Syncrosim, after which it simulates proportional probabilistic transitions from state to state with respect to the current relative coverage of each state class. The SyncroSim software boasts a number of packages for different types of simulations: at its core, a basic state-and-transition model simulates only relational change, and so can be used for applications as varied as finance and epidemiological spread, but only the stsim and stsimsf packages are needed for ecological modeling. SyncroSim also offers a landfirevegmodels package, using biophysical settings taken from The Nature Conservancys LANDFIRE project, which I used for much of my work, but I ended up needing to use the LANDFIRE models in the stsim package, due to an incompatibility between the rsyncrosim package for R and the landfirevegmodels SyncroSim package. "],["bps.html", "Section 4 Biophysical Settings 4.1 Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest and Woodland (BpS 13170_48_53)", " Section 4 Biophysical Settings The landscape rasters used in this project were produced by the LANDFIRE project, a joint effort between the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The stated mission of the LANDFIRE project is to produce consistent, comprehensive, geospatial data and databases that describe vegetation, wildland fuel, and fire regimes across the United States and insular areas. As part of this work, LANDFIRE has produced a series of Biophysical Settings: pairings of both maps and documents spanning the United States, which describe (as best it can be reconstructed) the composition and coverage of vegetation as it was before the arrival of European colonists. The larger guiding areas for this work are defined in the Ecological Systems classifications by NatureServe. Biophysical settings, or BpS, as LANDFIRE calls them, include between three and five vegetation class states described in terms of qualitative and quantitative presence on the landscape, as well as through the transitions between them, emphasizing transitions of succession and those mediated by fire. These class states are categorized across different biophysical settings by a combination of tags: Early, Mid, or Late; 1, 2, or 3, and all, open, or closed. An early succesional class made up of native grasses might be labeled Early1:All across a number of biophysical settings, even when the specific species involved differ. BpS have been constructed with a combination of current geospatial data, historical data, and expert input, and are available to the public at https://landfire.gov/. 4.1 Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest and Woodland (BpS 13170_48_53) 4.1.1 Early1:All Class A is grasslands/savanna maintained by frequently recurring fire (1-5yrs). The dominant layer lifeform is grass/herbaceous with a sparse overstory of oak or pine. These patches would typically be less than 100ac, but may have been up to 500 acres. Native Americans used these lands for hunting, and agriculture/native plant gathering. If fire is absent, tree seedlings and sprouts will establish and move the community to the mid-seral, closed stage. 4.1.2 Mid1:Cls This is an early tree regeneration (root and stump sprouts) phase; fire frequency is about 3-9yrs. Any area that does not burn frequently is probably too moist and will be populated by mixed-mesophytic tree species. Class B needs to have some surface fire to remove the more mesic (ACRU, ACSA, LITU, FAGR) seedlings and saplings from the understory and remove some of the oaks and hickories as well. Otherwise, you cannot get to the open woodland/savanna stages. In the absence of these fires, these communities will move to the late-seral closed, mixed mesophytic class (Class E). Areas that receive frequent surface fires will be populated by fire-adapted species such as oaks and hickories. 4.1.3 Mid1:Open This class is defined as the mid-seral open oak-hickory savannas and woodlands with a fire return interval of 5-15yrs. 4.1.4 Late1:Cls Class D is defined as a late seral closed canopy oak-hickory forest. Open understories of oak seedlings exist. If the late-succession open forest type persists without any type of fire, it will eventually convert to a late-succession mixed mesophytic closed forest type. This conversion is a result of species shift from dominant oaks to dominant maple, tulip tree, and beech, which do not support fire as readily. 4.1.5 Late2:Cls Mixed (maple) forests develop during the absence of fire. Dense understories of shade-tolerant species develop. "],["nspatial.html", "Section 5 Non-Spatial Work 5.1 Future Work", " Section 5 Non-Spatial Work My first forays into SyncroSim started with non-spatial runs of a single BpS: the Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest, eco-region 53, identified as the primary biophysical setting in the Ironton district of the Wayne National Forest. Because the forest is disjoint, I used the Ironton district as a representative sample for the entirety of the Wayne in my exploratory work. As the initial runs were done aspatially, the shape of the district didnt matter at this stage, as I set the number of cells manually. To compensate for the lack of available geospatial data from the precolonial United States, LANDFIRE biophysical models are initialized with equal proportions of each succession class. Models are then run for 1000 time steps to allow the system to equilibrate under experts best approximation of historic disturbance and transition regimes, and those outcomes are treated as representative of the historic landscape. With this in mind, my first step was to isolate the model of interest to me and run it to state class equilibrium. Due to computational limits, I ran only six Monte Carlos of this scenario, so as not to spend the time and memory it would require to run more realizations. This limitation due to processing power was an ongoing theme of my exploratory work, and only my final productions, which did not include historic landscape percentages, were run with more than six realizations. I used the proportions of state classes resultant from the historical equilibrium runs and compared them to modern Sclass percent data for the Wayne National Forest, procured from previous work by the Nature Conservancy, running both through time steps 2020-2050, simulating the progression of the landscape 30 years out into the future. To these simulations I added a version for which the total transitions attributed by fire were reduced to zero, reflecting the current fire management regime on the Wayne National Forest. Figure 5.1: Near-future behavior for different parameterizations of the Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Biophysical Setting Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest State Class Descriptions It was at this point I noticed a discrepancy in the behavior of the succession classes. Notice that when fire is removed, the Late2:Cls class reduces to nearly nothing, while the proportions of Late1:Cls rise to near-complete domination of the landscape. Now look back at the description according to the Allegheny-Cumberland BpS. By all accounts, it is the mixed-maple stands which should dominate in the absence of fire and the oak-hickory forest which ought to become vanishingly small, but this model shows the Late2:Cls class, which corresponds to fire-sensitive mixed-maple woodlands, failing to thrive without fire. After a consultation with Randy Swaty of The Nature Conservancy, it was determined that those two states had, in fact, been transposed in the state and transition model. It is unknown at this point whether the LANDFIRE project writ large has been informed of this discrepancy and if it has been corrected. Figure 5.2: The Allegheny-Cumberland model with foliage percentages based on current land coverage, the transitions for Late1:Cls and Late2:Cls reversed Above, the red and blue lines show the original model runs, while the green and purple are from after modification to represent the flipped vegetation dynamics. The less dramatic change in class proportions between the green and blue runs reflects the mitigating effect of fire, while without fire, the maple class outcompetes the oak class to near exclusion. In reality, this model may not accurately describe the vegetation dynamics present on the Wayne National Forest, or else may be misleading in terms of the actualities of stand conversation. In conversation with Lisa Kluesner, of the Wayne Forest Service, she explained that while oak is still substantially present in the ecosystem, the conservation issue of the moment is that of replacement. As individual oaks age and die, or are cut in forest maintenance, the closed canopy prevents sapling growth and replacement of the trees, leading to eventual elimination of oak from the landscape. Fire has not been a routine aspect of forest maintenance in the United States for at least 70 years, and while the landscape of the Wayne is far departed from its precolonial identity, oak has not in that time been driven to complete exclusion: assuming all other factors remain static, it seems unlikely that in the next thirty years there will be a rapid and unprecedented downturn. The mixed-maple stands, in this context, must have their mixed quality emphasized. The transition of the landscape to this succession class represents not a complete vanishment of the existing oak, but a departure from the conditions which make the repopulation of oak viable, despite the persistance of individual organisms. With this in mind, and in the understanding that while some characteristic natural vegetation remains on the Wayne National Forest, the actual landscape dynamics are completely and irrevocably altered from what they were 250 years ago, the relevant goals for management are less about preventing the transition and mixing of stands and more about preserving those areas where oak can still grow to maturity as species repositories against the forest-wide continuing deaths of older oaks. In this circumstance, the inevitability of climate change has become a part of the restoration plan. As long as oaks and hickories can persist on those patches of land less hospitable to more mesophytic species, the warming and drying of the landscape will begin to push maples back out, and allow historically characteristic species to move back in, so long as those species can be somewhere preserved through time. 5.1 Future Work One of the challenges with modeling management options for the Wayne National Forest was that the biophysical setting which covers much of the Ironton district (used in this project as representative for work which could be expanded to the continuous forest and surrounding counties), the Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Woodland and Forest, has only two types of transitions defined: those of fire and succession. While this is perfectly appropriate for the modeling of pre-colonial landscapes, for which BpS were designed, it fails to capture the breadth of disturbances and management practices which may be run on a more fragmented landscape under modern curation. Adding transitions designed to reflect this management, and perhaps teasing out the box and arrow diagram in the state and transition simulation model, adding or splitting classes to encompass both uncharacteristic natural vegetation and uncharacteristic exotics currently present on the landscape, would allow for more fine-grained analysis and assessment of the ways in which different policies might contribute to land-management goals. Another modeling aspect to consider adding would be a successively increasing multiplier representing change in climate over time steps, probably using projected temperature increases and their relative effects on different vegetation classes as a proxy for climate change as a whole, with potentially aberrant weather damage thrown in. For spot-identifying areas of high management value, spatial analysis is necessary, as non-spatial runs can only identify landscape dynamics as a whole, and not areas of higher or lower intervention value, but as non-spatial runs are far less computationally costly than spatial runs, they are a good tool for testing new model parameters and inputs to ensure that the results make sense and are appropriately impacting the model. "],["spatial.html", "Section 6 Spatial Modeling", " Section 6 Spatial Modeling As with the nonspatial aspects of this project, the Ironton district was used as representative and an adequate landscape for proof of concept in the spatial exploration. The LANDFIRE project offers a number of geospatial products: both biophysical setting and succession class were downloaded from their website and clipped to the shape of the Ironton district using an R scrip developed by Myles Waalima, in concert with the Conservation Data Lab project. SyncroSim takes raster inputs, here in the form of TIF files. The biophysical setting raster was used as model input, while the succession class raster was input under state class. There were two primary issues that came up when I attempted spatial modeling, the first easily resolved, the second not so much. After rasters are loaded into SyncroSim for a spatial run, the software reads in the number of rows and columns and the cell size from the files, then calculates the cell size in acres, the number of cells, and the total area in acres from this information. This provides an immediate assurance that SyncroSim is able to read the data and a confirmation that the raster contains some amoutn of information, which made it especially confusing when every spatial run I attempted to run quit with a -1 error, citing no cells, when I could from the raster calculations that there were, in fact, 1.4 million available cells to read. SyncroSim has three layers to a given model - the container layer, called the library, which controls macro aspects of the model like multiprocessing and the input of directive R scripts; the intermediate layer, called project, which controls those factors which remain constant across different scenarios of the same library; the deepest layer, scenarios (sub-scenarios also exist, but were not used for this work), hold the box and arrow diagrams, run control, spatial and non-spatial run conditions, and other multipliers affecting the probabilities and outcomes of scenario runs. Thus, in my non-spatial explorations of the biophysical setting, there had been minimal need to explore outside of the individual scenario and I had not familiarized myself with the higher level containers. In SyncroSim, for each raster model input, the corresponding raster band ID for each relevant cell value must be provided in the project layer so that SyncroSim can read the raster. The freq() call in R returns a list of these values and their presence by number of cells in any given raster. Figure 6.1: Setting appropriate ID numbers for spatial model runs Once the appropriate ID numbers for the model and state classes were determined and entered into SyncroSim, spatial model runs proceded as would be expected. Figure 6.2: Shape of the Ironton district Figure 6.3: Modern succession class distribution for the Ironton on time step one Pictured above are the initial conditions for the distribution of succession classes on the Ironton, while below are the models of the landscape after 30 years. Figure 6.4: Comparison of Ironton district SClass distribution under historic burn and fire suppression management regimes As expected, the historic probability of transitional fire results in the maintenance of the closed-canopy oak Sclass, while in the model where fire has been removed, there is almost a complete shift to closed-canpy mixed maple forests, with some residual oak savannah remaining in patches on the landscape, an output aligned with that of the non-spatial runs. Noticeable in the left map of Figure 6.4, though the proportions of the S Classes have remained relatively the same as those in the first time step, above, the distribution has become scattered, and trends toward a discretized, pixel-forward image rather than a continuous map. In SyncroSim, state class transitions are probabilistic, and calculated individually for each pixel at every time step using the given transition probabilities from the model. When transitions are calculated for each cell as an individual without relationship to the overarching landscape, the resultant map ends up patchy and discontinuous. Figure 6.5: Sampled transition map from an intermediate time step While SyncroSim does have ways to manage transition spread and distribution to simulate a more likely model for propagtion of something like a fire, I never managed to make them work in this model. For a more realistic visualization, transitions would be spatially clustered, and human-initiated transitions such as controlled burns or harvest would not only be self-contained but localized to roads and borders, where the forest is easier to access. In the continuation of this work, solving the problem of spatial propagation is a first step toward making connectivity maps suggestive for long-range management plans. The other noticeable feature of these maps is that of their patchy occupation of the Ironton district. Aside from a few pale patches where larger roads cross-cut this chunk of forest, the base raster for the Ironton district is a continuous block of land, if with few features visible when rendered in R. By contrast, the realizations produced by SyncroSim peter out across the northeast region, with noticeable gaps across the full expanse. Unlike the scattered nature of the modeled transitions, which can be much credited to my inexperience with the software, the gaps in the map itself are endemic to the way SyncroSim works. As noted early on in my spatial work, a critical aspect of running a spatial model in SyncroSim is setting the appropriate ID values for whatever rasters are input to build up the model. Because of how LANDFIRE data is structured, it has a basic incompatibility with SyncroSims methods of reading spatial information. All LANDFIRE BpS models are constructed with the same building blocks in terms of cover type and structural stage. Any number of BpS models might have an s-class corresponding to an early-1 cover type of all structural stages, and in the succession class GIS data which can be downloaded from the LANDFIRE website, every instance of Early1:ALL or Late2:CLS will have the same ID value, despite representing different types of vegetation, depending on their biophysical setting. That the state class types dont have different IDs between BpS models in the geospatial data is inconvenient, but can also be solved without much hassle by recombining rasters, which is, regardless, necessary for connectivity work. In SyncroSim, however, there is no way to differentiate an Allegheny-Cumberland Dry Oak Forest and Woodland Early1:ALL from a South-Central Interior Mesophytic Forest Early1:All, nor to create multiple instances of that combination that are then separable in the spatial outputs. While this is not a problem for non-spatial runs, if the desired outcome for a spatial run in SyncroSim is to then take a generated map and assess changes in connectivity with the altered vegetation under different management, one must either attempt to run all classes separately and mosaic them together in a third party software or allow that only one biophysical setting can be examined at a time. "],["rssim.html", "Section 7 SyncroSim in R", " Section 7 SyncroSim in R Along with using SyncroSim from the GUI, one of the goals of this project was to create functional SyncroSim scripts in the R package rsyncrosim that could then, with very little editing, be repurposed to run the same kinds of spatial realizations using other landscapes, particularly without having to do any work in GIS-specific software. This objective sprang out of the Conservation Data Lab, and from the R scripting work of mentor and founding member Myles Waalima. As a project of Randy Swatys and an affiliate of The Nature Conservancy, the CDL and its constituent members do a good deal of work with LANDFIRE products: as such, Myles original code takes the GRID directory files for LANDFIREs biophysical setting, succession class, existing vegetation cover, existing vegetation height, existing vegetation type, vegetation departure, and mean fire return interval geospatial products, clips them to the extent of an input shape file, and then returns both a set of new, clipped rasters and a series of charts and tables visualizing landscape data in terms of metrics like degree of vegetation departure by succession class. It was his work to take as input a continental-United-States-wide data file, clip it, and return a relevant raster which I built upon in the rsyncrosim package, with the idea of producing a stock code which might, with the input of LANDFIRE data and a shapefile, return a model of a landscape under different management classes, or at least of the impact of the predominant biophysical setting on that landscape. The documentation for rsyncrosim can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsyncrosim/rsyncrosim.pdf, and was for the most part enormously helpful in writing code to run SyncroSim through R. I would strongly recommend familiarizing ones self with SyncroSim through the GUI before scripting simulations in R, but after doing so, it becomes easy enough to figure out what calls to make by using the datasheet() call on any level of your project. Lower levels report out the function names for higher level aspects of the work under a category called scope, so a datasheet(myScenario) call will give you access to the name in rsyncrosim paired with the name used in the SyncroSim GUI of any aspect of your work you want to edit - the only downside of calling the scenario, rather than project or library, is that it extends the results, which can make them more difficult to read. Because running a spatial model requires setting the model ID, my code makes several basic assumptions to do with biophysical setting. The first is that there any given project (and, indeed, library), has only one state and transition simulation model associated with it. While this may not be true for other uses of stsim, because the state classes can only be indexed to one model at a time, I feel it is a fair assumption to make about any model run with LANDFIRE data. The second is that this singular model is based in whichever BpS is most represented on the chosen landscape, with the metric of representation measured in raw pixel count. If this is not the case, the sheetData$ID variable can be manually changed in the code to whichever ID is most appropriate, but this is the base functionality. As with the model ID, in any STSM run from scratch, state class IDs must also be set for SyncroSim to function properly. However, unlike with the model, where BpS names cannot be extracted from the raster, and as such the automation of the ID requires some assumption, the structure of LANDFIRE BpS data allows for unambiguous automated value assignment. The script reads in a CSV file containing all of the LANDFIRE S classes and then loops sequentially through that list, comparing its contents to that of the state classes in the StSim model. Because the state class raster values always ascend in a predictable order and by single integers, despite not spanning all available S classes they can still be reliably valued. I had sorted out all of this, and with it the other issues which arise when working with an unfamiliar software package (yes, its worth checking your working directory again, even though youre 100% sure you already checked it), and, while I was able to execute a blank-slate-to-full-SyncroSim-realization code run, I could not then extract any of the resultant rasters from R. They clearly existed: when I checked SyncroSim, I could view the maps for every simulated transition, but all attempts to produce them in R resulted in the code aborting with a message that the package I was attempting to call did not exist. Some troubleshooting later, I discovered a peculiarity of the rsyncrosim package. While most calls in rsyncrosim make specific reference to the SyncroSim package theyre requesting - a datasheet save addressed to stsim_Stratum, for example, can modify the values in the primary tab of the SyncroSim project level - the datasheetRaster function takes only the second half of that argument. Rather than telling datasheetRaster to look in stsim_OutputSpatialState for the desired spatial outputs, it takes the argument OutputSpatialState only, and then concatenates the package name to the front. In stsim, the primary SyncroSim package for state and transition simulation modeling, this is probably a perfectly good shorthand. To the best of my knowledge, the state and transition simulation modeling done in Syncrosim with LANDFIRE data has thus far overwhelmingly emphasized non-spatial models, with even less work done in running the landfirevegmodels package through R rather than the GUI. With the landfirevegmodels package in SyncroSim comes all of the state and transition models for every biophysical setting across the United States and affiliated territories, and the package loads into the SyncroSim GUI an export feature which makes it easy to isolate a particular model. So long as you dont want to extract any rasters from your simulations to R, this works perfectly fine. Rasters can be copied from SyncroSim to the clipboard and thus extracted. The other option, and the one I took, is to instead do all work from the stsim LANDFIRE library, which can be downloaded separately from http://landfirereview.org/search.php. The process of extracting models becomes slightly more time consuming - you have to copy the library, delete every model but the model of interest from the project layer of the folder, and then use the compress function from the File menu on the newly shrunken library - but not substantially more difficult. Because the model is now running in the stsim package, all work can then be done in R without conflict. After finishing the code to feed in your own data and from that, crop and run a raster, I added a secondary, much shorter code, which extracts a raster from a spatial run previously done in SyncroSim. "],["next.html", "Section 8 Next Steps", " Section 8 Next Steps With limited time in a quarter and other obligations and responsibilities, my work on the Wayne National Forest was far from exhaustive. Practical and proof of concept work in R and SyncroSim, with a focus on state and transition simulation modeling predominated, while the connectivity work, which turned out to be more challenging in both concept and execution than expected, didnt quite make it off the ground during this time frame. This is not the end of my work with The Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Data Lab, as I plan to continue this project at least throughout the summer, though the bulk and product-oriented side of it will likely be handed off to Randy Swaty and those with more in-depth knowledge of ecology and in particular the ecological systems prevalent on the Wayne than I possess. My ongoing work will likely focus more in the gaps and lumps in the procedure and the viability of extending spatial modeling into Omniscape for connectivity work. First and foremost, if there is ever to be any desire to use these models for actual policy directives, the problem with spatially-propagating transitions needs to be addressed. A map which comes out of a SyncroSim simulation unrealistically patchwork is useless for connectivity modeling and adds almost no information to that which gain be obtained from a non-spatial model. Following Randys general directive to go down rabbit holes for about ten hours, and then, if not making progress on something, to move on, I abandoned that train of thought when it became a clear breakpoint in my ability to get anything done, but now that Im on my own time and nobody can stop me, it really is a critical distinction between work that is cool but lacks practical purpose and genuine information which can be used to generate more information. As an addendum to this, creating transition types to model for management interventions such as harvest and whatever else the Wayne National Forest thinks is important, as well as adding states for uncharacteristic natural and exotic vegetation, if the spatial work can be made to cooperate both in the propagation of fire and in Omniscape connectivity models, to begin assessing the value of actual management strategies. This was something that Randy and I discussed several times as an objective for this probject, and work that I am blazingly underqualified for, as became clear to me when I tried paramaterizing a resistance raster for a baseline Omniscape run using LANDFIREs current geospatial data. The raster values I created will work fine for proof of concept and method development, which is really where my skills and role in this project lie, but I know nothing about the difference between mid-seral closed Tuliptree and mixed white pine and oak and other things with underlying laurels and it shows. My second continuing goal is to develop an understanding of Omniscape and a methodology such that so long as transition-propagating rasters can be generated, they can easily be run in Omniscape. Ive had significant trouble trying to make and parameterize resistance rasters, as mentioned above, and I dont expect the actual numerical results from my realizations to be of any planning value, but I would like to finish out our original connectivity goals. Early in the project, too, Kim Hall suggested continuing work in testing the robustness of connectivity models to fine-grained changes in resistance values and then reporting out on it, an idea which has seized me by the left brain and refused to let go, and developing a strong familiarity with Omniscape and an ability to run it with at least functional, if not sensible models is important in that effort. Third, and as a more auxiliary goal, I would like to practice some Cloud-based computing. This was something Randy and I began pursuing through Amazon Web Services, in response to the computing power necessary to run multiple synchronous spatial realizations in SyncroSim overrunning my laptops memory and the time needed to run them sequentially being impractical. While I dont believe that the current state of the SyncroSim models merits any more than superficial test runs, particularly given the lack of spatial propagation, it is an important skill for me to develop, and if we get to the point of running models that are informative from a land-management perspective, it will be a necessary resource. Essentially: weve already started, might as well continue. Leaving room for any work I do with the Conservation Data Lab to exceed these bounds, these are my objectives for this project beyond my graduation, and with this bookdown record maintained as a living document as to the process and outcomes, to eventually be completed as a record of the Wayne National Forest project in its entirety.
